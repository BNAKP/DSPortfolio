# Principal Component Analysis Project

## Project Overview
Principal Component Analysis - Using PCA techniques for noise reduction and to remove background signals so an effective algorithm could be used to counteract sample drift effects from an Electron Microscopes measurement of the chemical composition of thermoelectrics

### Problem
During my masters i was invited to join a research group at the University of Aberdeen as a research assisitant. In my work i investigated the correlations and relationships between goals and variables in the UN sustainable development goals database. The key focus was to identify if any variables had a causal relationship or if changing one can have a negative or positive impact on another. Each goal in the database had 100s of variables contributing to its outcome and so it was first necessary to identify the most important variables in the goals and identify the relationship between them. Multiple algorithms were used such as spearman correlation, eigenvector centrality and community detection to determine the best method for calculating causal inference between the goals. The outcome of this analysis was instrumental in advising what a countries government should focus on to ensure the best possible route towards a sustainable future.
