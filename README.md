# Data Science Project Portfolio

## About
This is a repository i created to showcase all my personal and professional data science projects.

### Professional and Academic Projects [Completed]
1. [Causality](https://github.com/BNAKP/DSPortfolio/tree/main/Causality) - Using spearman correlation, eigenvector centrality and community detection to determine the causal inference between variables in the UN SDGs.
2. [Principal Component Analysis](https://github.com/BNAKP/DSPortfolio/tree/main/Principal%20Component%20Analysis) - Using PCA techniques for noise reduction and to remove background signals so an effective algorithm could be used to counteract sample drift effects from an Electron Microscopes measurement of the chemical composition of thermoelectrics.
3. [Revenue Forecasting](https://github.com/BNAKP/DS_Portfolio/tree/main/Revenue%20Forecasting) - Using linear regression to set film forecasts based on Box Office, Genre and window to digital release.
4. [Growth Forecasting](https://github.com/BNAKP/DS_Portfolio/tree/main/Growth%20Forecasting) - Using time series analysis to predict subscriber growth on DTC streaming service.
5. [Audience Segmentation](https://github.com/BNAKP/DS_Portfolio/tree/main/Audience%20Segmentation) - Using Clustering & Classification to identify key audience viewing trends to target high risk churn groups for CRM campaigns.

### Professional Projects [Ongoing]
1. [Marketing Ad Spend Analysis] - Using regression to model the relationship between marketing spend, impressions/reach, CTR and conversion/acquisition to optimise ad spend on the social media platforms.
2. [Identify Growth Opportunities] - Using k-means clustering to group territories and then random foreast regressor to evaluate which social and economic features impact digital spend to select markets to focus growth efforts on.
3. [A/B Testing] - Using bayesian A/B testing to measure the impact of pricing and windowing changes in driving revenue growth.

### Additional Personal Projects
1. [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/BNAKP/DS_Portfolio/tree/main/Practice%20Projects/House%20Price%20Prediction) - Using linear regression and random forest to predict house prices
