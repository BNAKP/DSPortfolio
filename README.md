# Data Science Project Portfolio

## About
This is a repository created to showcase my personal and professional data science projects.

### Professional and Academic Projects [Completed]
1. [Causality](https://github.com/BNAKP/DSPortfolio/tree/main/1.%Causality) - Using spearman correlation, eigenvector centrality and community detection to determine the causal inference between variables in the UN SDGs.
2. [Principal Component Analysis](https://github.com/BNAKP/DSPortfolio/tree/main/2.%Principal%20Component%20Analysis) - Using PCA techniques for noise reduction and to remove background signals so an effective algorithm could be used to counteract sample drift effects from an Electron Microscopes measurement of the chemical composition of thermoelectrics.
3. [Revenue Forecasting](https://github.com/BNAKP/DS_Portfolio/tree/main/3.%Revenue%20Forecasting) - Using linear regression to forecast digital revenue based on Box Office, Genre and window to digital release.
4. [DTC Growth Forecasting](https://github.com/BNAKP/DS_Portfolio/tree/main/4.%Growth%20Forecasting) - Using time series analysis (XGBoost) to forecast subscriber growth trends on DTC streaming service.
5. [DTC Audience Segmentation](https://github.com/BNAKP/DS_Portfolio/tree/main/5.%Audience%20Segmentation) - Using Clustering & Classification to evaluate key audience behaviour trends to categorise customers by LTV groups and identify highest churn risk users to target with CRM campaigns.

### Professional Projects [Ongoing]
6. [A/B Testing](https://github.com/BNAKP/DS_Portfolio/tree/main/6.%AB%20Testing) - Using bayesian A/B testing to measure the impact of pricing and windowing changes in driving revenue growth.
7. [Marketing Optimisation](https://github.com/BNAKP/DS_Portfolio/tree/main/7.%Marketing%20Optimisation) - Using marketing mix modelling to measure the media impact on digital sales to optimise ROI on ad spend, taking into account marketing metrics (spend, impressions etc) while accounting for external factors such as seasonality and macroeconomic trends.
8. [Identify Growth Opportunities](https://github.com/BNAKP/DS_Portfolio/tree/main/8.%Growth%20Opportunities) - Using k-means clustering to group territories and then a random forest regressor to evaluate which social and economic features impact digital spend the most to select markets to focus growth efforts on.

### Additional Personal Projects
9. [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/BNAKP/DS_Portfolio/tree/main/Practice%20Projects/House%20Price%20Prediction) - Using linear regression and random forest to predict house prices
