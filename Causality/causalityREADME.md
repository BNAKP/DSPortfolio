# Causality Project

## Project Overview
Causality - Using Principal Component Analysis and Correlation to determine the causal inference between UN SDGs

### Problem
During my masters i was invited to join a research group at the University of Aberdeen as a research assisitant. In my work i investigated the correlations and relationships between goals and variables in the UN sustainable development goals database. The key focus was to identify if any variables had a causal relationship or if changing one can have a negative or positive impact on another. Each goal in the database had 100s of variables contributing to its outcome and so it was first necessary to identify the most important variables in the goals and identify the relationship between them. When evaluating the relationship between goals there were too many dimensions to compare and so I had to perform principal component analysis to transform these data points into a single dimension so that the correlation analysis could be performed. The outcome of this analysis was instrumental in advising what a countries government should focus on to ensure the best possible route towards a sustainable future.
