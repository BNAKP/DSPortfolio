# Causality Project

## Project Overview
Causality - Using correlation to determine the causal inference between variable in the UN SDGs

### Problem
During my masters i was invited to join a research group at the University of Aberdeen as a research assisitant. In my work i investigated the correlations and relationships between goals and variables in the UN sustainable development goals database. The key focus was to identify if any variables had a causal relationship or if changing one can have a negative or positive impact on another. Each goal in the database had 100s of variables contributing to its outcome and so it was first necessary to identify the most important variables in the goals and identify the relationship between them. Multiple algorithms were used such as standard correlation, centrality and xxx to determine the best method for calculating causal inference between the goals. The outcome of this analysis was instrumental in advising what a countries government should focus on to ensure the best possible route towards a sustainable future.
